Description: Studies including both microbiome and metabolomics data are becoming more common. 
    Often, it would be helpful to integrate both datasets in order to see if they corroborate 
    each others patterns. All vs all association is imprecise and likely to yield spurious 
    associations. This package takes a knowledge-based approach to constrain association 
    search space, only considering metabolite-function interactions that have been recorded
    in a pathway database. This package also provides a framework to assess differential 
    association.
