Description: Anansi is a framework to measure and compare associations between two 'omics datasets based on field knowledge. 
    The intended use is to compare functions in the microbiome to metabolites these fucntions are known to interact with, 
    but theoretically anansi could be used for any two measurement types as long as they have a defined interaction framework.
