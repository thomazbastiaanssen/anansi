Description: Studies including both microbiome and metabolomics data are 
    becoming more common. Often, it would be helpful to integrate both datasets 
    in order to see if they corroborate each others patterns. All vs all 
    association is imprecise and likely to yield spurious associations. This
    package takes a knowledge-based approach to constrain association search 
    space, only considering metabolite-function pairs that have been recorded in
    a pathway database. This package also provides a framework to assess 
    differential association.
