# Introduction
The `anansi` package computes and compares the association between the features 
of two 'omics datasets that are known to interact based on a database such as 
KEGG. Studies including both microbiome and metabolomics data are becoming more 
common. Often, it would be helpful to integrate both datasets in order to see if
they corroborate each others patterns. All vs all association is imprecise and 
likely to yield spurious associations. This package takes a knowledge-based 
approach to constrain association search space, only considering 
metabolite-function interactions that have been recorded in a pathway database.
This package also provides a framework to assess differential association. 

While `anansi` is geared towards metabolite-function interactions in the context 
of host-microbe interactions, it is perfectly capable of handling any other pair 
of datasets where some features interact canonically. A very early version of 
`anansi` was used to generate "Extended Data Fig. 7" in that paper. 

## Installation
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# install and load anansi
# devtools::install_github("thomazbastiaanssen/anansi")
library(anansi)

# load ggplot2 and ggforce to plot results
library(ggplot2)
library(ggforce)

# Anansi supports parallelisation through the future.apply framework. 
# You can call it like this:
# plan(multisession)

# load anansi dictionary and complementary human-readable names for 
# KEGG compounds and orthologues
data(dictionary)

# load example data + metadata from FMT Aging study
data(FMT_data)
```

# Data preparation

The main `anansi` function expects data in the `anansiWeb` format; Basically a 
list with exactly three tables: 
The first table, `tableY`, should be a count table of metabolites.
The second table, `tableX`, should be a count table of functions. 
Both tables should have columns as features and rows as samples.

The third table should be a binary adjacency matrix with the column names of 
`tableY` as rows and the column names of `tableX` as columns. Such an adjacency 
matrix is provided in the `anansi` library and is referred to as a dictionary 
(because you use it to look up which metabolites interact with which functions).  

Though this example uses metabolites and functions, `anansi` is able to handle 
any type of 'omics data, as long as there is a dictionary available. Because of 
this, anansi uses the type-naive nomenclature `tableY` and `tableX`. The Y and X
refer to the position these measurements will have in the linear modeling 
framework: 

$$Y \sim X \times {\text{covariates}}$$

### A note on functional microbiome data

Two common questions in the host-microbiome field are "Who's there?" and "What 
are they doing?". Techniques like 16S sequencing and shotgun metagenomics 
sequencing are most commonly used to answer the first question. The second
question can be a bit more tricky - often we'll need functional inference 
software to address them. 
For 16S sequencing, algorithms like PICRUSt2 and Piphillin can be used to infer 
function. For shotgun metagenomics, HUMANn3 in the bioBakery suite can be used.  
All of these algorithms can produce functional count data in terms of KEGG 
Orthologues (KOs). These tables can be directly plugged in to `anansi`. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Clean and CLR-transform the KEGG orthologue table.

# Only keep functions that are represented in the dictionary.
KOs <- FMT_KOs[row.names(FMT_KOs) %in% sort(unique(unlist(anansi_dic))), ]

# Cut the decimal part off.
KOs <- floor(KOs)

# Ensure all entires are numbers.
KOs <- apply(KOs, c(1, 2), function(x) as.numeric(as.character(x)))

# Remove all features with < 10% prevalence in the dataset.
KOs <- KOs[apply(KOs == 0, 1, sum) <= (ncol(KOs) * 0.90), ]

# Perform a centered log-ratio transformation on the functional count table.
KOs.exp <- clr_c(KOs)

# anansi expects samples to be rows and features to be columns.
t1 <- t(FMT_metab)
t2 <- t(KOs.exp)
```

# Weave a web🕸️

The `weaveWebFromTables()` function can be used to parse the tables that 
we prepared above into an `anansiWeb` object. 
The `anansiWeb` format is a necessary input file for the main `anansi` workflow. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
web <- weaveWebFromTables(tableY = t1, tableX = t2, dictionary = anansi_dic)
```

# Run anansi🕷️

The main workspider in this package is called `anansi`. Generally, you want to 
give it three arguments. First, there's `web`, which is an `anansiWeb` object, 
such as the one we generated in the above step. Second, there's `formula`, which
should be a formula. For instance, to assess differential associations between 
treatments, we use the formula `~Legend`, provided we have a column with that 
name in our `metadata` object, the Third argument. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
anansi_out <- anansi(
  web = web,
  formula = ~Legend,
  metadata = FMT_metadata,
  adjust.method = "BH",
  verbose = TRUE
)
```
# Spin to a table📝

`anansi` returns a wide format table as an output. For general reporting, we 
recommend sticking to the table format as it's the most legible. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyr)

# Use tidyr to wrangle the correlation r-values to a single column
anansiLong <- anansi_out |> 
  pivot_longer(starts_with("All") | contains("FMT")) |>
  separate_wider_delim(name, delim = "_", names = c("cor_group", "param")) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = param, values_from = value) 

# Now it's ready to be plugged into ggplot2, though let's clean up a bit more.
# Only consider interactions where the entire model fits well enough.
anansiLong <- anansiLong[anansiLong$full_q.values < 0.1, ]
```
# Plot the results

The long format can be helpful to plug the data into `ggplot2`. Here, we 
recreate part of the results from the FMT Aging study.

```{r}
#| plot_FMT, eval=TRUE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, 
#| fig.alt="Differential association plot, with facets separating metabolites 
#| and metabolites on the y-axis. x-axis depicts pearson's correlation 
#| coefficient."
ggplot(anansiLong) +

  # Define aesthetics
  aes(
    x = r.values, y = feature_X,
    fill = cor_group, alpha = disjointed_Legend_p.values < 0.05
  ) +

  # Make a vertical dashed red line at x = 0
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", colour = "red") +

  # Points show  raw correlation coefficients
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3) +

  # facet per compound
  ggforce::facet_col(~feature_Y, space = "free", scales = "free_y") +

  # fix the scales, labels, theme and other layout
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev, position = "right") +
  scale_alpha_manual(
    values = c("TRUE" = 1, "FALSE" = 1 / 3),
    "Disjointed association\np < 0.05"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "Young yFMT" = "#2166ac",
      "Aged oFMT" = "#b2182b",
      "Aged yFMT" = "#ef8a62",
      "All" = "gray"
    ),
    breaks = c("Young yFMT", "Aged oFMT", "Aged yFMT", "All"), "Treatment"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("Pearson's \u03c1")
