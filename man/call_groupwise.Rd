\usage{
call_groupwise(web, method, groups, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables()} for how to weave a web.}

\item{method}{Correlation method.}

\item{groups}{A categorical or continuous value necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}

\item{metadata}{A vector or data.frame of categorical or continuous value necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score. If no argument provided, anansi will let you know and still to regular correlations according to your dictionary.}
}
\description{
If the \code{groups} argument is suitable, will also run correlation analysis per group. Typically, the main \code{anansi()} function will run this for you.
