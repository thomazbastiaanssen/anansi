\usage{
model_picker(
  web,
  which_dictionary,
  metadata,
  groups,
  formula,
  reff = NULL,
  modeltype = "lm"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables()} for how to weave a web.}

\item{which_dictionary}{A matrix derived from calling \code{which(web@dictionary, arr.ind = T)}. It contains coordinates for the relevant measurements to be compared.}

\item{metadata}{A vector or data.frame of categorical or continuous value necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score. If no argument provided, anansi will let you know and still to regular correlations according to your dictionary.}

\item{groups}{A categorical or continuous vector necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score.}

\item{formula}{A formula object. Used to assess differential associations.}

\item{reff}{A categorical vector typically depicting a shared ID between samples. Only for mixed effect models.}

\item{modeltype}{A string, either "lm" or "lmer" depending on the type of model that should be ran.}
}
\value{
a list of \code{anansiTale} result objects, one for the total model, one for emergent correlations and one for disjointed correlations.
}
\description{
Should not be run on its own. to be applied by \code{anansiDiffCor()}. Typically, the main \code{anansi()} function will handle this for you.
