\title{Run differential correlation analysis for all interacting metabolites and functions in case of non-stratified output.}
\usage{
collate_model_output_classic(web, stats_out, all_terms)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables()} for how to weave a web.}

\item{stats_out}{A vector containing all statistical output from \code{model_picker}.}

\item{all_terms}{A vector containing all RHS terms of the supplied model formula, including interactions.}
}
\value{
a list of \code{anansiTale} result objects, one for the total model, one for emergent correlations and one for disjointed correlations.
}
\description{
Typically, the main \code{anansi()} function will run this for you.
