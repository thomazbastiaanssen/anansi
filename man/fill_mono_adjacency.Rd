\title{Populate adjacency matrix based on membership information. This step can be very heavy on the memory.}
\usage{
fill_mono_adjacency(x, l, max_factor = 0.001, clean = T, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An unfinished adjacency matrix.}

\item{l}{An element of a list - a matrix with two rows, each row depicting one part of member pairs.}

\item{max_factor}{A proportion (0-1). The maximum proportion of the total dataset that can be a member of a group.}

\item{clean}{A boolean. Whether to explicitly remove temporary files in order to manage memory.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}
}
\value{
A populated adjacency matrix.
