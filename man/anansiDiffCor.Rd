\title{Run differential correlation analysis for all interacting metabolites and
functions.}
\usage{
anansiDiffCor(web, sat_model, errorterm, int.terms, metadata, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a
dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables()} for how to weave
a web.}

\item{sat_model}{A \code{formula} object, containing the full model}

\item{errorterm}{A \code{character vector}, containing the metadata col.name denoting repeated
measures.}

\item{int.terms}{A \code{character vector}, containing the metadata col.names denoting
covariates interacting with X to be tested for differential associations.}

\item{metadata}{A vector or data.frame of categorical or continuous value necessary for
differential correlations. Often a state or treatment score. If no argument
provided, anansi will let you know and still to regular correlations
according to your dictionary.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information
while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}
}
\value{
a list of \code{anansiTale} result objects, one for the total model,
one for emergent correlations and one for disjointed correlations.
}
\description{
Can either take continuous or categorical data. Typically, the main
\code{anansi()} function will run this for you.
