\title{Run differential correlation analysis for all interacting metabolites and functions.}
\usage{
anansiDiffCor(
  web,
  groups,
  adjust.method = adjust.method,
  resampling = resampling,
  locality = locality,
  reff,
  modeltype,
  verbose = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables()} for how to weave a web.}

\item{groups}{A categorical or continuous value necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score.}

\item{adjust.method}{Method to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons. \code{adjust.method = "BH"} is the default value. See \code{p.adjust()} in the base R \code{stats} package.}

\item{resampling}{A boolean. Toggles the resampling of p-values to help reduce the influence of dependence of p-values. Will take more time on large datasets.}

\item{locality}{A boolean. Toggles whether to prefer sampling from p-values from a comparison that shares an x or y feature. In a nutshell, considers the local p-value landscape when more important when correcting for FDR.}

\item{reff}{A categorical vector typically depicting a shared ID between samples. Only for mixed effect models.}

\item{modeltype}{A string, either "lm" or "lmer" depending on the type of model that should be ran.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}
}
\value{
a list of \code{anansiTale} result objects, one for the total model, one for emergent correlations and one for disjointed correlations.
}
\description{
Can either take continuous or categorical data for \code{groups}. Typically, the main \code{anansi()} function will run this for you.
