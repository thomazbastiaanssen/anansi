\title{Run differential correlation analysis for all interacting metabolites and functions.}
\usage{
anansiDiffCor(web, groups, reff, modeltype, verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables()} for how to weave a web.}

\item{groups}{A categorical or continuous value necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score.}

\item{reff}{A categorical vector typically depicting a shared ID between samples. Only for mixed effect models.}

\item{modeltype}{A string, either "lm" or "lmer" depending on the type of model that should be ran.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}
}
\value{
a list of \code{anansiTale} result objects, one for the total model, one for emergent correlations and one for disjointed correlations.
}
\description{
Can either take continuous or categorical data for \code{groups}. Typically, the main \code{anansi()} function will run this for you.
