\title{Run differential correlation analysis for all interacting metabolites and functions.}
\usage{
anansiDiffCor(web, groups, adjust.method = adjust.method)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables} for how to weave a web.}

\item{groups}{A categorical or continuous value necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score.}

\item{adjust.method}{Method to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons. \code{adjust.method = "BH"} is the default value. See \code{p.adjust} in the base R \code{stats} package.}
}
\value{
a list of \code{anansiTale} result objects, one for the total model, one for emergent correlations and one for disjointed correlations.
}
\description{
Can either take continuous or categorical data for \code{groups}. Typically, the main \code{anansi} function will run this for you.
