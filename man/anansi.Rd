\usage{
anansi(
  web,
  method = "pearson",
  groups = NULL,
  adjust.method = "BH",
  verbose = T,
  diff_cor = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables} for how to weave a web.}

\item{method}{Correlation method. \code{method = "pearson"} is the default value. The alternatives to be passed to \code{cor} are "spearman" and "kendall".}

\item{groups}{A categorical or continuous value necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score. If no argument provided, anansi will let you know and still to regular correlations according to your dictionary.}

\item{adjust.method}{Method to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons. \code{adjust.method = "BH"} is the default value. See \code{p.adjust} in the base R \code{stats} package.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}

\item{diff_cor}{A boolean. Toggles whether to compute differential correlations. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list of lists containing correlation coefficients, p-values and q-values for all operations.
