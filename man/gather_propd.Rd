\title{Run differential proportionality analysis using propr for all interacting features such as metabolites or functions.
Wraps around the propd function.}
\usage{
gather_propd(web, groups, verbose)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables()} for how to weave a web.}

\item{groups}{A categorical or continuous value necessary for differential proportionality Typically a state or treatment score.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}
}
\value{
a list with four matrices containing thetas and p-values for emergent and disjointed proportionality testing respectively.
}
\description{
Can either take continuous or categorical data for \code{groups}. Typically, the main \code{anansi()} function will run this for you.
