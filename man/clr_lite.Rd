\title{Impute zeroes and perform a centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation on your count table}
\usage{
clr_lite(counts, samples_are = "cols", method = "logunif", replicates = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A compositional count table.}

\item{samples_are}{Either "cols" or "rows". Default is "cols". Denotes whether the columns or rows depict indicidual samples.}

\item{method}{The method for zero imputation. One of "logunif", "unif" or "const".}

\item{replicates}{An integer. for the two random sampling methods, if this is larger than 1, every zero will be imputed that many times. The median of the CLR of all those replicates will be returned.}
}
\value{
A CLR-transformed count table.
