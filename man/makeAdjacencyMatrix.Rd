\title{Starting point to wrangle anansi dictionary list into binary adjacency matrix}
\usage{
makeAdjacencyMatrix(
  dict_list,
  tableY = NULL,
  max_factor = 0.001,
  clean = T,
  verbose = T,
  mode = mode
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dict_list}{A list that has tableY names as entries in the case of mode == "interaction" and group names in the case of mode == "membership". For general use, we recommend using the one provided in this package.}

\item{tableY}{A matrix containing y features of interest. Rows should be samples and columns should be features. Only used for mode == "interaction".}

\item{max_factor}{A proportion (0-1). The maximum proportion of the total dataset that can be a member of a group.}

\item{clean}{A boolean, whether to clear temporary files during the function.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}

\item{mode}{A character vector. Can be "interaction" or "membership". Toggles whether to link two datasets based on their interactions or based on shared group membership.}
}
\value{
a binary adjacency matrix with features from tableY as rows and features from tableX as columns.
}
\description{
Takes the anansi dictionary in list format and wrangles it into a binary adjacency matrix.
