\title{Wrangle anansi dictionary list into binary adjacency matrix}
\usage{
makeAdjacencyMatrixFromGroupMemberList(
  member_list,
  max_factor = 0.001,
  clean = T,
  verbose = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{member_list}{A list that has tableY names as entries in the case of mode == "interaction" and groupnames in the case of mode == "membership". For general use, we recommend using the one provided in this package.}

\item{max_factor}{A proportion (0-1). The maximum proportion of the total dataset that can be a member of a group.}

\item{clean}{A boolean, whether to clear temporary files during the function call.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.}
}
\value{
a binary adjacency matrix with the group members on both the rows and columns.
}
\description{
Takes the anansi dictionary in list format and wrangles it into a binary adjacency matrix based on group membership.
For general use, should probably not be called directly, but rather through \code{\link{weaveWebFromTables}}.
