\title{Investigate validity of the Anansi Call}
\usage{
assessAnansiCall(web, groups, diff_cor = diff_cor, modeltype, reff, method)
}
\arguments{
\item{web}{web An \code{anansiWeb} object, containing two tables with omics data and a dictionary that links them. See \code{weaveWebFromTables()} for how to weave a web.}

\item{groups}{A categorical or continuous value necessary for differential correlations. Typically a state or treatment score. If no argument provided, anansi will let you know and still to regular correlations according to your dictionary.}

\item{diff_cor}{A boolean. Toggles whether to compute differential correlations. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{modeltype}{A string, either "lm" or "lmer" depending on the type of model that should be ran.}

\item{reff}{A categorical vector typically depicting a shared ID between samples. Only for mixed effect models.}

\item{method}{Correlation method. \code{method = "pearson"} is the default value. The alternatives to be passed to \code{cor()} are "spearman" and "kendall".}
}
\value{
a list including a modified \code{groups} and \code{diff_cor} argument.

\description{
Calls both assessGroups and assessModelType.
This is a helper function called by \code{anansi}.
