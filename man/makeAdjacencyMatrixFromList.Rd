\title{Wrangle anansi dictionary list into binary adjacency matrix}
\usage{
makeAdjacencyMatrixFromList(tableY = NULL, dict_list, mode = "interaction")
}
\arguments{
\item{tableY}{A matrix containing features of interest. Rows should be samples and columns should be features.}

\item{dict_list}{A list that has tableY names as entries in the case of mode == "interaction" and groupnames in the case of mode == "membership". For general use, we recommend using the one provided in this package.}

\item{mode}{A character vector. Can be "interaction" or "membership". Toggles whether to link two datasets based on their interactions or based on shared group membership.}
}
\value{
a binary adjacency matrix with the group members on both the rows and columns.
}
\description{
Takes the anansi dictionary in list format and wrangles it into a binary adjacency matrix based on which tableY features are present in both the dictionary and  \code{tableY}.
For general use, should probably not be called directly, but rather through \code{\link{weaveWebFromTables}}.
