\title{Wrangle anansi dictionary list into binary adjacency matrix}
\usage{
makeAdjacencyMatrixFromList(tableY, dict_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{tableY}{A matrix containing metabolites of interest. Rows should be samples and columns should be features.}

\item{dictionary}{A list that has compound names as entries. For general use, we recommend using the one provided in this package.}
}
\value{
a binary adjacency matrix with compounds form tableY as rows and functions from tableX as columns.
}
\description{
Takes the anansi dictionary in list format and wrangles it into a biary adjacency matrix based on which compounds are present in both the dictionary and  \code{tableY}.
Should probably not be ran directly, but rather through \code{\link{weaveWebFromTables}}.
