\title{Create an anansiWeb object from two 'omics tables and a dictionary}
\usage{
weaveWebFromTables(
  tableY,
  tableX,
  dictionary = anansi::anansi_dic,
  max_factor = 0.001,
  clean = clean,
  verbose = T,
  mode = "interaction"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tableY}{A table containing features of interest. Rows should be samples and columns should be features. The Y and X refer to the position of the features in a formula: Y ~ X.}

\item{tableX}{A table containing features of interest. Rows should be samples and columns should be features. The Y and X refer to the position of the features in a formula: Y ~ X.}

\item{dictionary}{A list that has feature names from tableY as names. Default is the dictionary provided in this package.}

\item{max_factor}{A proportion (0-1). The maximum proportion of the total dataset that can be a member of a group. Only used for membership adjacency matrices.}

\item{clean}{A boolean, whether to clear temporary files during the function. Only used for membership adjacency matrices}

\item{verbose}{A boolean. Toggles whether to print diagnostic information while running. Useful for debugging errors on large datasets.
For general use, we recommend sticking to that one. You can access the dictionary like this: \code{data(dictionary)}}

\item{mode}{A character vector. Can be "interaction" or "membership". Toggles whether to link two datasets based on their interactions or based on shared group membership.}
}
\value{
an \code{anansiWeb} object. Web is used as input for most of the main workflow of anansi.
}
\description{
This function will take two dables of 'omics data, for example metabolomics and functional microbiome data. It will also take a dictionary list, which is provided in this package.
